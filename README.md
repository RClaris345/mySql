Going through this hmw took a little bit of time for me to be able to get the concepts to link together. I understand how to use mySQL but struggled on how to start. Once i get a good start I feel confident to finish but it was hard to get my head to priortize everything. 
The first thing I did was create a connection from my SQL to VS Code. I did that by dialing to MySQL what I wanted and from there pressed the call the button. So i created my database and table through this call.
After that I started my first function that would ask the question what the user would like to buy an how many with the help of inquirer.
From there I had to create another function that would take the users input and use it to update and reflect my table, targetting the quatitiy of my product and how much the user would be spenind.g
To upadate the quantity was not too bad I just had to set a varaible that refelcted the the stock and quantity response and then subtract them to give me the new number. Then from there used inquier to update my table with that new data. 
The next thing was to get a price to display taking the stock * price to get my answer.
The last thing was setting my else statement to default by saying there is not enough stock and to try again.
Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk
